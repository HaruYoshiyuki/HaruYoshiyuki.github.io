        <p>I really want to design and make my own web application with full functions and ease of access, which means it can be loaded even when the system is a little bit old. In addition, that website maybe a personal blog, I may upload my writings, or scanlations of my favorite mangas,...</p>

            <p> "Our preoccupation with other people - whether we aid or hinder them, love or hate them - is at bottom a means of getting away from ourselves. It is strange to contemplate that competition with others - the breathless race to get ahead of others - is basically a running away from ourselves."</p>
