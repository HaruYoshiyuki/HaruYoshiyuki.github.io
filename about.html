        <p>So like, recently i've taken up reading some romance manhwa and among those i came across "Death is the only ending for the villainess", which is one of the best manhwa i've ever read. Basically, the plot follows Penelope Eckart, a princess taken from the slums in place of the lost princess, but actually her soul is of a reincarnated person from the modern world and the world of princess Eckart is just based on a game called 'The lady's love love project'. Tranferred along with the female protag is a system helping? or hindering her goal to survive.</p>
        <p>A picture (on the right) of one of my favorite character in the manhwa "Death is the only ending for the villainess", I'm really impressed that the light pink hair does not make him look feminine:</p>

        <P>And below is the picture of the protag:</P>
        <img src="images\Penelope_Eckhart__Adult_.png" alt="Adult penelope eckart" class="penelope">
        <p>Aaaaaaand another picture of her with the signature of the author:</p>
        <img src="images\Anh-1.jpg" alt="penelope in white dress" class="penelope-1">

        <p>She really is pretty, isn't she? And the drawing is reallllly spot on</p>
